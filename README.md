# Tower of Hanoi
A final project of course MTH10407 - Object Oriented Programming of VNUHCM - university of Science.

The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower[1] and sometimes pluralized as Towers) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. 
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 
* Only one disk can be moved at a time. 
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. 
* No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Objective

* Build a class to represent the concept of the stack.
* Use Stack in a non-recursion function. 
* Export the movement of the plates and the number of moves
* Using OpenGL librar
* Application of the OpenGL library and showing the movement of the forks from pile to pile.
